Currently going to start the last assignment for PWA Class.

4:35pm
I have coded all of my code &I have tested my code to see if all of it runs.
I did find that there was 1 failed test which is the ReverseString test, So I will be checking my code for any errors & fixing the errors if there are any.

2/1/25 TIME: 9:29AM
Yesterday I left off by testing my code a few times and when I tested it,
one of the tests failed. I fixed the error that needed to be fixed within
my reverseString variable & after I fixed it I ran the test again and all of the tests passed.
Currently I am going to submit my assignment.
